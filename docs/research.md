## Vision
My research sits at the intersection of environmental toxicology, disease aetiology, and evolutionary genetics. I investigate how exposure to toxins and additives shapes host biology, disease susceptibility, population dynamics, and evolutionary processes. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a tractable model, I combine controlled chronic exposure with high‑replication fitness and molecular readouts.

## Current projects
### Endogenous Viral Elements (EVEs) in Drosophilidae
- Comparative genomics pipeline for EVE detection and curation; phylogenetics and population context.  
- Building an annotated resource to support manuscripts and future grants.

## Methods and skills
- Molecular: PCR/RT‑qPCR.  
- Drosophila: husbandry, dissection, behavior (Ctrax). 
- Analytics: R, Linux, GenAlEx, MEGA, Cervus, STRUCTURE.
