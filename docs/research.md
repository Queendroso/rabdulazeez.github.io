## Vision
My research niche sits at the intersection of environmental toxicology, infection biology, and evolutionary genetics. I investigate how chronic exposure to toxins (especially heavy metals such as lead) alters host physiology, immune defence, and microbiome or symbiont interactions, thereby shaping susceptibility to infection. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a tractable model, my work integrates controlled experimental exposure with fitness and molecular readouts, and extends to multi-generation designs to test whether toxin-driven vulnerabilities can persist through host adaptation, microbial mediation, or evolutionary change.

## Current projects
### Endogenous Viral Elements (EVEs) in Drosophilidae
- Comparative genomics pipeline for EVE detection and curation; phylogenetics and population context.  
- Building an annotated resource to support manuscripts and future grants.

## Methods and skills
- Molecular: PCR/RT‑qPCR; RNA workflows; small‑RNA/RNA‑seq (core facilities).  
- Drosophila: husbandry, dissection, behavior (Ctrax), gnotobiotic workflows.  
- Analytics: R (survival, mixed models, mediation/SEM), Linux, population genomics.  
- Facilities: Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility (MVM), Metabolomics, ICP‑MS.
